# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This repo is all about using Machine Learning Classifier to detect if a person has heart disease or not based on 14 given parameters
The algorithms used are as follows  - 1. Random Forest Classifier    2. K-Nearest Neighbour
   The input parameters are age
   sex
   chest pain type (4 values)
   resting blood pressure
   serum cholestoral in mg/dl
   fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
   resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
   maximum heart rate achieved
   exercise induced angina
   oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
   the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
   number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
   thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
